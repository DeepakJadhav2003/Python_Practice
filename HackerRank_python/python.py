# 1. The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN,  and . Add code to print three lines where:

# The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
# The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
# The third line contains the product of the two numbers.

    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    
    print(a + b)
    print(a - b)
    print(a * c)

# 2. The provided code stub reads two integers,  and , from STDIN.
# Add logic to print two lines. The first line should contain the result of integer division,  // . The second line should contain the result of float division,  / .
# No rounding or formatting is necessary.

    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    
    print(a//b)
    print(a/b)
